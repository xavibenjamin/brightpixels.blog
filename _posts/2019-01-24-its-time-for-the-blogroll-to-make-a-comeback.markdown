I find myself reading more and more personal blogs these days. While many ditched their RSS reader years ago, I've always had my list of subscriptions. Some of my favorite people stopped writing over the years, but more are writing on their blogs again as we've come to understand [the cost of a centralized&nbsp;web](/2019/01/the-cost-of-a-centralized-web/).


Unfortunately, I feel as if there's isn't a good way of finding this content. <mark>Remember the blogroll? Maybe it's time we bring that back.</mark> I'll be adding mine to the footer of this site soon. Kyle Dreger has one [on his blog](https://audaciousfox.net/masthead#other-writers-worth-reading), which helped me find a few new writers that I've come to love. These types of personal recommendations are much better than any algorithm. 

I've also created [a GitHub repo](https://github.com/smithtimmytim/personal-blogs). If you write a personal blog, please add your info to the list. If you don't know how to use GitHub, no problem! [Send me an email](mailto:smith@ttimsmith.com?subject=My personal blog) with your info, and I'll add it for you. I'm hoping we can build a diverse list of people writing about a whole range of different topics.

The reality is that no one wants to write in a void (which is what made platforms like Medium so appealing), but with small measures like this, we can start exposing more people to the excellent content out there.
