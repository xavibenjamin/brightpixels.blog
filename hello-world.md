Thank you so much for visiting my online home. *Bright Pixels* is a web-column I've written since 2013. When I first launched this site, it was called *The Bold Report*. In 2017, [I changed the name to *Brightly Colored*](/2017/10/a-new-beginning/). Unfortunately, that name didn't work either, so [I decided on *Bright&nbsp;Pixels*](/2019/01/introducing-bright-pixels/).

*Phew*. Now that we've got that out of the way allow me to introduce myself. I'm [Tim Smith](https://ttimsmith.com/), a former designer and frontend developer, currently working as the Senior Producer at [Changelog Media](https://changelog.com/).

This site has over 600 posts. Some are pretty good; others are ok, some are downright bad. And guess what? That's ok. The site serves to document my interests and opinions at that moment. Just as a person goes through different phases of life, so has this site. There have been periods where I write a lot about a particular topic, then move on to another. _Bright Pixels_ is a reflection of my life, my personal growth, my successes, and my sorrows.

I have three main rules for myself:

1. I’ll write whenever I feel like it, and won’t worry if it’s not perfect
2. I **will not** look at stats of any kind
3. I will write because it’s fun and has a personal archival purpose, **not** because I want recognition or validation

When I follow those rules, I find my writing fulfilling and of much better quality.

Here are a few articles I feel are representative of my writing:
- [The Cost of a Centralized Web](https://brightpixels.blog/2019/01/the-cost-of-a-centralized-web/)
- [Exclude Posts From RSS in Jekyll](https://brightpixels.blog/2017/11/exclude-posts-from-rss-in-jekyll/)
- [My Brief Review of *Star Wars: The Last Jedi*](https://brightpixels.blog/2017/12/my-brief-review-of-star-wars-the-last-jedi/)

After chatting with my friend [John Locke](https://twitter.com/Lockedown_), it made sense to consolidate the enormous list of topics I'd amassed over the years into a select few. Two days and many hours later, I'd recategorized more than 600 posts. Here are topics I write about most:

- [Apple](/apple/): This isn't an Apple blog, but I enjoy their products, so I have opinions from time to time.
- [Code](/code/): I don't code for work anymore, but when I learn something new I like to write about it.
- [Comics](/comics/): New comics come out every week, so there's lots to write about here.
- [Star Wars](/star-wars/): My all-time favorite franchise.

There are three ways to keep up with all the latest and greatest:

- [*Bright Pixels Dispatch*](/subscribe/): This weekly email goes out on Friday. Your info is never shared or sold. Ew.
- [RSS Feed](https://feedpress.me/brightpixels): If you don't know what RSS is, [here's a good introduction](https://www.lifewire.com/rss-101-3482781).
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brightpxblog): The account is updated with every new post.

And that's it! Happy reading.
